# Dictionary and Autocomplete using Trie

## Overview

This project focuses on creating an efficient AutoComplete and Dictionary system using Trie, a sorted tree-based data structure. The name "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval," highlighting its role in information retrieval.

Trie is particularly well-suited for storing sets of strings and facilitates quick and easy searches for words based on prefixes. Unlike other data structures, Trie employs a structure with pointers equal to the number of characters in the alphabet, making it an optimal choice for searching and organizing words.

## Key Features

1. **Word Retrieval:** The system allows users to find words, their meanings, and delete entries efficiently.

2. **AutoComplete Functionality:** Users benefit from autocomplete suggestions based on previously entered words. Trie's ability to find words with common prefixes enhances this feature.

3. **Efficient Searching:** Trie significantly accelerates search operations, reducing complexities and providing a faster alternative to other data structures like binary search trees.

4. **Alphabetical Order:** The inherent structure of Trie maintains an alphabetical order, facilitating organized and structured access to the stored data.

## Functions

The project code includes several functions to support its functionalities, such as:

- **getnode:** Creates nodes for the Trie data structure.

- **display/view:** Provides a mechanism to visualize the Trie or view its contents.

- **insert:** Inserts new words into the Trie, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

- **search:** Enables users to search for specific words in the Trie, offering quick and accurate results.

... and many more functions designed to enhance the overall functionality of the system.
